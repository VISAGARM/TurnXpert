# TurnXpert

Overview
This project presents an adaptive turn system for electric vehicles with a 2-wheel drive system, eliminating the use of differential gears for enhanced performance. The system utilizes a sensing element placed above the steering rack, interfaced with an Arduino. The Arduino, through precise RPM control of the individual wheel motors, enables the vehicle to turn smoothly and efficiently.

Features 
Differential Gears Elimination: The system eliminates the need for traditional differential gears, simplifying the design and enhancing overall performance.

Adaptive Steering: The sensing element detects differences in wheel positions during turns, and the Arduino adjusts the motor speeds in real-time for optimal turning performance.

Arduino IDE Implementation: The project is developed using the Arduino IDE, making it easily accessible for a wide range of users and developers.
